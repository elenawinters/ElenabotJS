# ElenabotJS

This is a Twitch bot made by myself, Elena, for personal use.

## Why JavaScript (Node)?

The original Elenabot in Python was great (if not overly complex), but I didn't end up using it much after some time.

While working on another project, I wrote up the twitchWeb.js file, because I needed a browser based twitch chat solution.

This project maintains both the twitchWeb.js and the twitch.js libraries.

## What about TypeScript?

I do want to eventually write this in TypeScript, but for the time being, JavaScript suffices.
